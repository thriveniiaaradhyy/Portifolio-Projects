Summary of COVID-19 Data Exploration Using SQL

This project focuses on exploring global COVID-19 data through SQL, with a deep dive into infection rates, mortality trends, and vaccination progress across various countries. By utilizing SQL queries, we extracted key insights from a comprehensive dataset containing case numbers, death counts, population data, and vaccination information. The following analyses were conducted:

Key Analyses Conducted:
ðŸ”¹ Infection Rate Analysis: Identified countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
ðŸ”¹ Mortality Trends: Calculated case fatality rates (CFR) to determine regions with the highest mortality.
ðŸ”¹ Vaccination Progress Tracking: Analyzed cumulative vaccination trends over time and their impact on infection spread.
ðŸ”¹ Data Insights & Techniques: Used aggregation, filtering, sorting, and window functions to identify key patterns in the data.

Additionally, this project incorporates CTEs, views, subqueries, and temporary tables to optimize query performance and enhance data analysis. The findings highlight the power of SQL in handling large-scale health data, providing meaningful insights to support public health decisions.
